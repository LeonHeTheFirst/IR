Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999 , and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period .
Although , as you will have seen , the dreaded ' millennium bug ' failed to materialise , still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful .
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days , during this part-session .
In the meantime , I should like to observe a minute 's silence , as a number of Members have requested , on behalf of all the victims concerned , particularly those of the terrible storms , in the various countries of the European Union .
Please rise , then , for this minute 's silence .
( The House rose and observed a minute 's silence )
Madam President , on a point of order .
You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka .
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam , who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago .
Would it be appropriate for you , Madam President , to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament 's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation ?
Yes , Mr Evans , I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate .
If the House agrees , I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility .
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again .
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually .
It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability .
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible .
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report , not a legislative proposal , and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday .
That is precisely the time when you may , if you wish , raise this question , i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report .
Madam President , coinciding with this year 's first part-session of the European Parliament , a date has been set , unfortunately for next Thursday , in Texas in America , for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death . We shall call him Mr Hicks .
At the request of a French Member , Mr Zimeray , a petition has already been presented , which many people signed , including myself .
However , I would ask you , in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community , to make representations , using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent , to the President and to the Governor of Texas , Mr Bush , who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person .
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld .
Thank you , Mr Segni , I shall do so gladly .
Indeed , it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted .
Madam President , I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest .
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin .
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia , too , access to environmental information is a constitutional right .
Now , however , he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing .
We know , and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed , including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year , that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings .
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea , and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament 's position , as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted , clear as far as Russia is concerned .
Yes , Mrs Schroedter , I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter .
Madam President , I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that , during this first part-session of the new year , the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably .
But , Madam President , my personal request has not been met .
Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one , there is still no Dutch channel , which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month .
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well .
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors ' meeting on Wednesday .
It will , I hope , be examined in a positive light .
Madam President , can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes ?
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected ?
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998 ?
Why has there been no fire drill , either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings ?
Why are there no fire instructions ?
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident ?
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced ?
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves .
Mrs Lynne , you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done .
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors , and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on .
Madam President , Mrs Díez González and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President , Mrs de Palacio , which appeared in a Spanish newspaper .
The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session .
I would ask that they reconsider , since this is not the case .
The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio 's intervention , on another occasion , and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November .
Mr Berenguer Fuster , we shall check all this .
I admit that , at present , the matter seems to be somewhat confused .
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be .
Madam President , I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today 's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia , considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past ?
Today 's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there .
So Parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority .
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo .
As people have said , the situation there is extremely volatile .
There is , in fact , a risk of a military coup in the future .
We do not know what is happening .
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people ?
In any event , this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday .
Agenda
The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure .
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday .
Relating to Wednesday :
The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission .
I would like Mr Barón Crespo , who made the request , to speak to propose it . That is , if he so wishes , of course .
Then we shall follow the usual procedure , hearing one speaker in favour and one against .
Madam President , the presentation of the Prodi Commission 's political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi , who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech .
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and , therefore , basically dictates this Parliament 's political and legislative activity for the next five years .
I would also like to point out , Madam President , that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature . It did so again during this legislature , in July , and then , in September , it voted once more to approve the whole Commission .
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens .
To this end , I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September , which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible .
The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents , that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma . Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme , in which case it should clarify it .
According to its President , it is in a position to do so .
Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio , I believe that , before voting , it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme , as agreed . Alternatively , Parliament is not ready to examine this programme , as some appear to be suggesting .
In my opinion , this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament , as well as introducing an original thesis , an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware , in writing , of a speech concerning the Commission 's programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier , as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February , so we could forego the debate , since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it .
My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen , debate and reflect , there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that , if the Commission is ready to do so , we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens .
Therefore , the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , and which you have mentioned , is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday , including its proposed administrative reform , because , otherwise , we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation : on the pretext that there is no text , on the one hand , the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and , on the other hand , there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based .
Therefore , Madam President , I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote .
( Applause from the PSE Group )
Madam President , I really am quite astonished at Mr Barón Crespo 's behaviour and the fact that he is now asking for this item to be put on Wednesday 's agenda .
Mr Barón Crespo , you were unable to attend the Conference of Presidents last Thursday .
I am not criticising this ; it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them .
Mr Hänsch represented you on this occasion .
In the Conference of Presidents , we had an in-depth discussion .
Your Group was alone in advocating what you are saying now .
We then put it to a vote . As you know , each chairman has the same number of votes as his Group has Members .
There was a vote on this matter . As I recall , the outcome of this vote was 422 votes to 180 with a few abstentions .
This means that all the Groups with the exception of the non-attached Members - but , of course , they are not a Group - were in agreement ; only your Group thought that we should proceed as you have proposed here .
All of the others were of a different opinion .
That was the decision .
I should now like to comment on the issue itself .
We have confidence in the Commission and in Romano Prodi and , after a difficult procedure , as everyone knows , the vast majority of our Group supported the vote of confidence in Romano Prodi and the Commission .
We believe , however , that the Commission 's strategic plan needs to be debated within a proper procedural framework , not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the European Parliament , but also on the basis of a document which is adopted in the Commission and which describes this programme over the five-year period .
There is no such document !
The Commission will present its programme for the year 2000 in February .
We have said , very well , if the Commission does not wish to introduce the 2000 programme as early as January then we will do it in February .
We have agreed to this . After all , we do not wish to quarrel with the Commission ; if at all possible , we believe that the Commission and Parliament need to tread the same path .
However , we in Parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the Commission and we do not have to agree with everything which comes out of the Commission .
I should like us to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the five-year programme in our Groups .
You cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this House and have no idea of its content .
That is why we would recommend - and it is my impression that the Commission is also open to this idea - that we hold the debate on the Commission 's long-term programme up to the year 2005 in February - and I hope that the Commission will agree on a programme before then which it will propose to us - and that , at the same time , in February we also hold the debate on the Commission 's legislative programme for the year 2000 . The fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together .
That is why my Group firmly rejects the proposal made by the Socialist Group .
( Applause from the PPE-DE Group )
Madam President , I would like to make it very clear that , above all , the Commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this Parliament and , amongst those , the decision establishing its agenda .
We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide .
But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate , as Mr Barón Crespo has reminded us , which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission 's legislative programme , on the broad areas of action for the next five years , that is to say , for this legislature .
Madam President , I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission 's legislative programme .
I would also like to say that the Commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally , on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups .
Therefore , Madam President , I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and , when Parliament decides , - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and , next month , the programme for 2000 , which is what we fully agreed upon .
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated .
( Parliament rejected the request ) President .
Still on the subject of Wednesday 's sitting , I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax .
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda .
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this ?
Madam President , I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists . I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda , because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter .
I do not know whether this information is correct , but the PPE-DE Group would , in any case , be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already .
Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind .
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda .
Thank you , Mr Poettering .
We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request .
Madam President , I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering 's lack of logic .
He has just been preaching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents , and now he is doing just the same .
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous , with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups . As my fellow chairmen will recall , I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax , but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it .
It is not a lot to ask .
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out , once and for all , the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion , particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference .
We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group 's request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda .
( Parliament rejected the request , with 164 votes for , 166 votes against and 7 abstentions )
Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate .
Thank you very much .
Madam President , has my vote been counted ? I was unable to vote electronically , since I do not have a card .
My vote was " in favour " .
Indeed , if we add the two Members who have declared themselves , then the result of the vote would be .. ..
Madam President , the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote .
There is no room for amendments .
Ladies and gentlemen , once again , we see it is essential for Members to bring their voting cards along on a Monday .
Clearly there is a problem here .
That being the case , I shall have to make a decision .
I too forgot my card , and I would have voted against .
I therefore consider that the oral question may be kept on the agenda as per the vote .
This is the last time that we shall make allowances for Members who have forgotten their cards .
Let that be clearly noted and understood .
( Applause ) The oral question will therefore remain on the agenda , and yes , your President is entitled to vote just as she is entitled to forget her voting card .
We shall continue with the other amendments to the agenda .
Madam President , in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group .
That did not happen .
I would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group .
This is an important matter .
It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis .
Madam President , I do not wish to reopen the debate , but I had also asked for the floor , to comment on Mr Barón Crespo 's motion .
You did not call me either .
I regret this , but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there .
I am terribly sorry , Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox . I did not see you asking to speak .
Even so , I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes .
When we adopt the Minutes for today 's sitting tomorrow , then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments .
This seems to me to be a workable solution .
Of course , the Minutes for tomorrow 's sitting will take into account any additional explanations .
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes .
Mr Cox , Mr Hänsch , would this be acceptable to you ?
Madam President , if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not , and cannot , object to that .
If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote , I accept that but with reservations .
We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes , as we always do , of course .
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted , then we may correct them , if necessary .
( The order of business was adopted thus amended )
Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods
The next item is the report ( A5-0105 / 1999 ) by Mr Koch , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland waterways ( C5-0208 / 1999 - 1998 / 0106 ( COD ) ) .
Commissioner , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council 's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland waterway .
Firstly , we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96 / 35 / EC , which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training , instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly .
Secondly , by adopting this directive we achieve a ) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped ; b ) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c ) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market .
Thirdly , this directive , as it currently stands in the common position , guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union ; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States ' bearing a high level of individual responsibility .
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed .
Our amendments from the first reading have , I believe , been taken into account very satisfactorily .
They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance , or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included , for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions .
The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport , which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive , is something which I would urge you to support .
By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force , we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay .
I would urge you to endorse this .
Madam President , we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads , but also on our railways and waterways , not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster .
As an Austrian , I still have a vivid memory , as , I believe , we all do , of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel , where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense .
The renovation project , which lasted for months , cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe .
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit .
In fact , all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province .
Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available , so that the right action is taken in good time .
All the same , we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety .
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards .
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement .
I should like to address one final point . We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that , where transport safety in Europe is concerned , there is still much more to be done .
In this context , I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible , who is with us here today , to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future , so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale .
Madam President , first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has , at its heart , the issue of transport safety .
The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road , rail and inland waterway .
I congratulate him on his excellent report .
Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently : the Paddington rail crash in London , the terrible rail crash in Norway , the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified .
The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament 's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament 's other amendments has been retained .
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible .
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety .
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved .
Madam President , I would like to make a few comments .
I would like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and , secondly , the Commission for the proposal it has submitted .
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also , in fact , with minimum requirements .
This is a pity , in a sense .
Needless to say , safety on roads , railways and inland waterways is of key importance and , given the international nature of these types of transport , training for safety advisors should also be harmonised , therefore , as well as the requirements of the new ADR , for example , which is under way .
This is important , but so is enforcement and there are , of course , a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this .
Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years , for example in Belgium , the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead .
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here , with all the obvious risks that this entails .
Furthermore , it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium , Finland , but also in Japan has shown that 50 % of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment .
In short , the issue is an important one .
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned , in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year .
There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present , especially with smaller companies , as these cannot afford safety advisors .
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which causes problems .
It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses .
The work is done . All that remains is the business of enforcement .
I would like to mention one final point .
With regard to enforcement , proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001 , that is to say in eighteen months ' time .
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period .
This is not in itself anything dreadful , but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road , rail and inland waterways and incorporate these , as part of the acquis communautaire , as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states .
Madam President , the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so .
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks , known and unknown , for employees and the social environment .
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements .
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive , 95 / 35 / EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods .
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations , although I would have preferred it if uniform , set standards and modules had been established , so that certificates would be of equal value internationally .
This , however , does not seem feasible .
Finally , the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can , therefore , give it my wholehearted support .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which , though technical , are nonetheless of very great significance for safety .
I should like to make just a few comments .
Firstly , I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety , be it on the roads , on the waterways or at sea .
Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998 , even though Parliament responded relatively quickly , this time lag is a little too long .
This is not just the fault of the Commission , but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well .
My second point has already been mentioned : it concerns the minimum standards .
In principle , I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules .
However , when it comes to safety , I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden , for example , is in principle no different from safety in Germany , Italy or Austria .
I can live with these minimum standards , but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully .
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation .
My third point has also been mentioned already .
As you know , like Mr Rack , I come from a transit country , where this issue plays a particularly important role .
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries .
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum , in all countries , whether they are transit countries or not .
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Koch , on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal ; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland waterway .
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy , and in particular the transport group , is magnificent .
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and , at second reading , we can accept the amendment on the proposed date , which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission , bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question .
Very briefly , I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission 's priorities in the field of transport .
As Mr Simpson has said very correctly , this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end. The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day .
In this regard , I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels , which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to , which , in the case of Austria , is doubtless a very sensitive issue , and great effort should be made to improve their safety .
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently , the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves .
Margarine and a few kilos of paint which , in principle , do not present risks , led to a genuine disaster .
Therefore , we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved .
Finally , I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport .
This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport , in light of the Erika disaster , and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport .
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission .
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster , we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety , but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances , which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem .
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur , Mr Koch .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .
Transport of dangerous goods by road
The next item is the report ( A5-0104 / 1999 ) by Mr Koch , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94 / 55 / EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [ COM ( 1999 ) 158 - C5-0004 / 1999 - 1999 / 0083 ( COD ) ] .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , which entered into force on 1 January 1997 , contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time , the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN , that is the European Committee for Standardisation .
Delays in the CEN 's work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive .
In particular , annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments .
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job .
In this respect , I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94 / 55 / EC which has been tabled for discussion today .
Should the European Union fail to take action , then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period , until the CEN completes its work , which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty .
The amendment to the directive on today 's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community .
It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines , deletes provisions which are no longer applicable , and lays down the procedures for a ) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b ) enacting less stringent national regulations , in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas .
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the Member States obtain more powers .
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own . In so doing , it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure .
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999 .
The proposal to be discussed today , to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road , dates from May 1999 , however , and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure .
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure .
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months .
In addition , the need for greater transparency has been pointed out .
A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements , in particular for vacuum tanks , if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20 º C. This is in the special interest of northern European regions .
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it .
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety , but I would ask you to endorse this report .
Mr President , colleagues , a happy new year and millennium to you all .
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session , so this is quite exciting for me , a little like first love , although that did last longer than two minutes .
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission 's proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road .
It is good that this directive should be established now , as , otherwise , Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time , a period of transition , which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy .
The Commission 's proposal , however , does not take account of all the facts , such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions .
Consequently , I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch 's intrinsically excellent report , which have been adopted by our committee .
My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods .
According to the Commission 's proposal -20 º C would have been sufficient . On the shores of the Mediterranean , it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that .
There is support for the EU in Lapland also , so let us remember them .
I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40 º C. This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously .
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow 's vote .
Mr President , with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate .
I thought that it was quite superb .
On the subject at hand , I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe 's roads , railways , and so on are as safe as possible .
This directive is a contribution to this .
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance .
The rapporteur , Mr Koch , to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this , has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN , which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive .
That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that , in 2001 , we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer .
Commissioner , Mr President , I would first like to thank Mr Koch for his excellent report , which I do not have a great deal to add to .
I would like to take the opportunity just to point out that the transport of dangerous goods continues to cause major problems , not just in India , where I have just come from , but also within the EU .
We only have to think of the serious accident in the Mont Blanc Tunnel about a year ago , not to mention the one in the Tauern Tunnel .
We observe that there is always a possibility of major problems of this kind occurring where nature gives rise to troublesome phenomena such as mist , storms or cold weather , particularly in the narrow Alpine passes .
In general , I would urge that the transport of dangerous goods is transferred more to rail .
In this context , when planning future railway tracks or motorways , a preventative approach should be taken and the appropriate long-term solution built into the process early on . I would remind you of the Brenner base tunnel , which has not been touched on even indirectly .
While I am on the subject , I would also like to point out that transport problems are one of the key issues facing the EU and call on the Commission to give due attention to this . We need to have much more probing and vigorous debate on cutting-down on transport , heavy rail traffic , road pricing and railway privatisation , with a view to improving functionality .
Considering that enlargement towards the East will create a few more problems , then it becomes clear to us all that the future credibility of the EU will depend on whether , and in what manner , we succeed in sorting out the transport situation .
Mr President , the report we are discussing here does not , in itself , entail any major changes .
Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature .
It is nonetheless worth emphasising that , each time we make this type of decision , it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market .
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU , both on roads and railways and by sea .
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind .
In area after area , we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States .
This is extraordinarily positive , and there is cause to thank the rapporteur , Mr Koch , for the work he has put in on this issue .
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned .
If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running , it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also , as far as possible , apply to every country .
I should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance , namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament , Mr Ari Vatanen .
In many ways , the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another .
By approving this amendment , we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union .
This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind .
It is good that , in establishing the present regulations , we can also be flexible .
I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment .
Mr President , I would like to thank not only Mr Koch , but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority .
The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously .
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations , and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts , in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible .
For one thing is clear : even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union , traffic does not stop at our borders , it goes beyond them .
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions .
If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at ?
Mr President , I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report , which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport .
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation ( CEN ) has not been able , in the required time , to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union .
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours .
A moment ago , Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures , not of 20 degrees below zero , but of 40 degrees below zero .
Of course , we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union , which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature .
I would like to say , with regard to Mr Swoboda 's comments on the activity of the CEN , that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if , despite the new deadline , we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded .
Lastly , Mr President , the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out . We have referred to the delay by the CEN , the amendment of certain provisions , the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific .
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur , Mr Koch , which are contained in the various amendments , specifically four .
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination
The next item is the report ( A5-0108 / 1999 ) by Mrs Schroedter , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund : guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 [ COM ( 1999 ) 344 - C5-0122 / 1999 - 1999 / 2127 ( COS ) ] .
Mr President , Commissioner , ah , now I see Commissioner Fischler is here , and there I was thinking that you would not be coming .
Welcome to Parliament !
Ladies and gentlemen , we cannot overlook the fact that the benefits of the European internal market are reaped most of all by the wealthy regions , and even there they are not enjoyed by all sections of the population .
How long do we actually intend to allow this kind of development to go on for , resulting as it does in the widening gulf between poor and wealthy regions ?
Whilst , in the fifth report on the situation in the regions , unemployment was seven times higher in the poor regions than in the wealthy regions , the sixth report is already talking in terms of it being eight times higher , despite the fact that European structural funds are pouring into the regions .
Hence , it will , of course , come as no surprise to anyone that the very preamble to the new structural funds regulation places great emphasis on the call for the funds to be implemented more efficiently and in a more concentrated manner in order to achieve the European objectives of high employment levels and sustainable development , to name but a few .
Parliament , but above all the Member States , demanded massive improvements .
This was very soon forgotten , however , when the Commission developed the new instrument for the purpose , the guidelines , and wanted to make the requirement for there to be efficiency , concentration , and simplification of administration in the implementation of the European structural funds more binding .
Subsequently , the Member State governments referred to the principle of subsidiarity and just wanted to get their hands on the money .
And so all that remained of the 1999 Berlin Summit was the indicative nature of the guidelines .
However , this at least places the Commission under the obligation to approve only those programmes that will actually enable European objectives to be achieved .
I may have my doubts as to whether this indicative instrument will actually succeed in achieving efficiency and increased concentration and in actually putting the European objectives into practice , but it is a fact that the guidelines will be of central importance to the negotiations for the Community development programme .
If you want our work at European level to be taken seriously , then you must also take it seriously yourselves !
Parliament was not in a position to go into the content of the guidelines because it was not consulted until the legislative period was long since past .
Now that the programming phases are so far on , there is little point in starting from scratch again .
That is why in my report I concentrate on the strategic nature of the instrument , with the blessing of the committee .
Firstly , the report assesses the impact of the instrument per se .
Secondly , it uncovers the shortcomings in the Commission document .
For example , the question of partnership was simply left out of the central part of the structural funds .
One searches the document in vain for the central principle , which calls upon the Member States to see that programmes are implemented at local level in conjunction not only with the local authorities and regions but also with local actors , business and social organisations , NGOs , unions , employers ' associations , women 's organisations , citizens ' initiatives and employment initiatives .
The question as to why it was left out has not been answered to date .
Parliament makes demands here that are of central importance .
It expects the Commission to only approve those programmes established on the basis of partnerships of this kind .
It surprised me , Members of the Conservative Group , to suddenly find that amendments aimed at dropping the decentralising approach had been produced overnight .
All I can say is try taking this to your regions and explaining to your electorate why the European principle of decentralisation is not to be put into practice in the regions .
Let me tell you , you will not escape from that one unscathed !
We cannot have a situation where we agree principles in this House and , when it comes to implementing them , everyone does their own thing again .
Incidentally , I would just like to address a comment to the government of my country , where there is a desire simply to ignore the horizontal Community policy concerning environmental protection and where it was maintained that there was no need to implement the FFH guideline .
I believe it is a good thing that the Commission is holding firm here .
This brings me to my final point .
The guidelines must serve as the hard and fast criteria we use to assess whether Article 1 of the regulation is actually being implemented .
I expect the Commission to ensure that the guidelines , which certainly allow for adequate flexibility , are in every sense the benchmark for the negotiations .
We represent the European position .
In other words , sustainability in transport policy must be taken into account every bit as much as the entitlement of women to a share of financial support , as must the fact that each programme should make provision for the overall contribution , thus enabling there to be sustainable urban development and truly model projects in rural areas .
This is what I expect the outcome of the Community development programmes to be , and I do not expect you to give way on this again .
How else otherwise do we propose to reduce the unemployment rate ?
Not by continuing to wait and trying to cheat our way through again .
We cannot wait .
In a few years time we will no longer be able to spend so much money on implementing European structural policy because a great many more countries will be joining us and then we will have no choice but to create much improved , more efficient and more concentrated structures . And that will only be the beginning .
I therefore expect the Commission to take Parliament 's demands seriously in the course of the negotiations and to actually put the European position into practice here , giving a progressive regional policy a chance at long last .
Mr President , it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament , namely Wales .
A major part of Wales , as you know , has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme .
It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face .
We have seen poverty growing in Wales ; and growing still further since 1997 .
We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen .
We are looking , therefore , within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality .
What is , however , deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been , in a sense , a success of the government . It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces .
That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront .
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality .
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures .
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects .
We look to it to challenge the UK Government , to ensure that the private sector , which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure , is involved in the planning stage .
Finally , we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent .
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent .
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales .
Mr President , our committee views these issues very differently and , to start , I will speak from the point of view of research .
We see it as a very positive sign that , in her own conclusions , the rapporteur has taken account of our committee 's proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts .
This will be possible with action on the part of governments , and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development .
Another matter we would like to address , specifically from the point of view of industrial policy , is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services , electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet , when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds .
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood .
The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry , but today those areas might have become a burden , and they may well be poor , meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production , as I might call it , and the production of services , because they are the industries of the future .
In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this , so on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I would draw the Commission 's attention to this issue .
Finally , as the committee representing energy , we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more , thus , through a process of coordination , increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums .
Mr President , I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague , Mrs Flautre , who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill .
I would like to draw people 's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion .
In the past , this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment .
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament 's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action .
We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment .
In her report , Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking , yet desperately needed .
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund .
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted , as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme .
It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance , which is subject to review after three and a half years , and the Member States ' annual national plans for employment .
We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively .
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposal presented by the Commission , in accordance with its mandate , is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
I would like to point out , however , that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us : maintaining a population in rural areas , given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture 's increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society .
This , as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment , which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity , exacerbates the exodus from rural areas .
The consequences do not inspire hope .
It is the young people who are disappearing , who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas , all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas .
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs .
We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union .
Agriculture only provides 5.5 % of employment in the Union .
Furthermore , three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes .
For this reason , one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas , outside of the agricultural sector , in sectors such as rural tourism , sport , culture , heritage conservation , the conversion of businesses , new technologies , services , etc. However , even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive , it is still essential , not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns , but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land , in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment .
Therefore , we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set . We want rural areas , at the dawn of the 21st century , to be competitive and multi-functional , both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities .
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium , and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues , which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport , Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17 .
In conclusion , I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that , for the European Union , maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter , the rapporteur , for her work .
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well .
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing .
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament , at least in spirit , because at this stage , it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise , and nothing but hot air .
The truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament , particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives .
In our amendments , we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives , so that their application should be reflected , in the best and most profitable way , by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are , when all is said and done , the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing .
In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives , we think that those who generate employment , the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment , that is , businesspeople , must participate in this initiative .
Small and medium-sized businesses , above all , need to take part in the distribution of these funds .
If they do not , if businesspeople feel marginalised , if entrepreneurs cannot take part , not only in managing but also in receiving these funds , we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly .
Also , in order to attain our objectives , to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment , it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies , to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies .
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business , which , by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations , but complementing them , never obstructing or excluding them , will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs .
Mr President , it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague , Mr Evans , of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status .
It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party .
Let me also remind him that when his party leader , Mr Hague , was Secretary of State for Wales , he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements .
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality .
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation .
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today .
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines .
The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration , to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine .
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector .
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future .
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about .
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape .
They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development , resulting in inevitable delays and underspends , particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement .
The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the Commission or in the civil service .
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate , while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes .
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration .
If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence , which will be the key to future success .
This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines : whether EU regional policy with a good , solid , enabling guideline , can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report . She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report .
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines .
We are badly behind now in this matter .
Hopefully , the stands Parliament has taken will help , however , in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation .
For the time , the report grew too large when it was being debated .
It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports .
At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy , bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality .
Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity , the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes .
It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes .
Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas .
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes .
Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes .
Funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned .
Projects have to be carried out more efficiently , more flexibly and they have to be made more productive .
While the report was being prepared , it was interesting to discuss the Union 's regional policy in general .
For us new members , it was the first time , and this was a very interesting process .
This report is very good and our Group supports it .
Mr President , Commissioner , as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group , Elisabeth Schroedter , has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission 's offices for several months .
Bearing this in mind , this House should , in any event , demand that , before the Community support frameworks for the period in question are approved , they be studied and submitted for debate in this Parliament , specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today .
This is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least-developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in European society and to the move towards a fairer Europe .
Mr President , we should not forget that the main , strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion .
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results .
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions .
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion .
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator .
Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population .
We will have to study several indicators , which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others , and how they are evolving .
It is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament 's plenary sitting today that Europe 's 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions .
This fact means that the European Parliament , the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically .
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity , as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives .
I do not think , however , that this report has come too late .
We need to consider it together , so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development , which have been drafted before the directives come into force , can be submitted for revision and proper assessment .
We all agree that we should ask that , halfway through these programmes , when the assessment of the directives is made , Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens ' representatives .
Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is , at least on the face of it , bureaucratic .
They need to see the political dimension working , to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens .
This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for .
I would like to think that , given his previous experience as a regional President , he will agree to propose indicators , and a strategy , which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity .
Mr President , I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following : there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds .
This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent .
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas .
This latter point is of particular importance .
While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers .
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone .
The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries , mainly through the upgrading of roads , water treatment and related transport networks .
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year , which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session .
Key EU programmes between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe .
The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date . This would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions , the poorer regions in Europe , are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone , as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital exist .
Budgets 2002 and 2003
The next item is the joint debate on the following three reports :
A5-0247 / 2002 by Mr Göran Färm on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the 2003 budget in view of the conciliation procedure before the Council 's first reading [ 2002 / 2027 ( BUD ) ] ;
A5-0246 / 2002 by Mr Guido Podestà on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the 2002 budget : implementation profile , transfers and supplementary and amending budgets ;
A5-0248 / 2002 by Mr Guido Podestà and Mrs Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on Draft Amending Budget No 3 / 2002 of the European Union for the 2002 financial year .
Mr President , Commissioner , honourable Members and those in the public gallery , the European Parliament is aiming to ensure that the Budget for 2003 is a real reforming budget .
There are two perspectives at the heart of this .
One is naturally the historic matter of enlargement , and the other is the need to reform the European Union in various areas .
The bulk of the work on the Budget will , of course , take place in the autumn , but we hope to be able to solve a number of important issues at the conciliation in July in conjunction with the Council 's first reading .
The document we are debating and shall be voting on today is about providing the European Parliament 's delegation with a special mandate ahead of this conciliation with the Danish Presidency and the Commission .
The interinstitutional agreement governing these conciliations highlights three areas that are to be given particular attention . These are agriculture , the fisheries agreements and the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
I suspect that we will not get very far this year on the issues of agriculture and fisheries policy .
With regard to agriculture , we are awaiting the Commission 's draft mid-term review , and many practical details are still missing when it comes to the reform of fisheries policy .
Naturally , we shall still be highlighting these issues .
With regard to agriculture , there are a number of practical requirements which we wish to address , for reform of agricultural policy ought to mean transferring resources from the traditional organisations of the market to rural development .
We shall also be putting forward a number of demands concerning environmental perspectives , the prevention of new disasters involving animal diseases , etc. We hope it will be possible for some points to be considered as early as July .
With regard to fishing , we shall primarily be requesting all the information on the Council 's plans for the future .
We hope to be able to identify the appropriations necessary for us to be able to maintain fisheries agreements with a number of important nations .
We naturally hope that this can take place without the drama seen last year when the whole agreement with Morocco collapsed , creating a difficult situation where all the work on the Budget was concerned .
We remain conscious of the fact that we also have to keep the promise we made last year of a further EUR 27 million to support the changeover from fishing to other industries in Spain and Portugal .
I believe we shall be able to sort out some of the details pertaining to these issues , but we have also looked into a number of other main points .
Let me start with the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
We hope to be able to have a serious discussion on the appropriations required , particularly for the EU to be able to deploy a new police force in Bosnia to relieve the troops we have had there .
We also hope to be able to bring about a preliminary discussion on a few other important points .
We at least need a little more information on the Commission and the Council 's intentions regarding the initiatives in Afghanistan and the Middle East .
That is crucial if we are to be able to solve the Budget problems concerning external assistance .
In our view , there are too few resources .
The fact that we have too few resources in category 4 , i.e. external assistance , is a structural problem .
We need some way of providing new resources .
That could be done in accordance with the proposals which the Commission has put forward , but which we know the Council dislikes , concerning a special flexibility instrument for external assistance .
The European Parliament has also put forward another alternative in this respect - a more active use of the emergency aid reserve .
It would be excellent if we could find a solution to this issue in July .
Discussions on the issue of enlargement are likely to dominate in July .
We mainly have to discuss the administrative resources needed to prepare the EU institutions for enlargement .
I want to stress that we are committed to this .
The timetable for enlargement must be adhered to .
Therefore , preparations have to commence as soon as possible .
It is vital to reach agreement on the administrative costs in category 5 in July 's conciliation .
However , the fact that we are prioritising enlargement does not mean that we can just automatically add more money for staff and other administrative costs .
We also have to be able to show that we can actively implement new priorities , particularly within the field of administration .
In the EU , as in every modern administration , we must show that we are able to develop our methods of working , to reprioritise and to become more efficient and modern before we request more money .
The Committee on Budgets has therefore decided to reject the use of the flexibility instrument in category 5 .
We believe that such use is contrary to the rules .
It should not be assumed from the outset that we must use flexibility instruments .
We now know that the Commission is requesting funding for 500 new posts for the purpose of dealing with enlargement .
I am convinced that these posts are necessary , but we must nevertheless ask a number of questions before we simply agree to such an increase .
Over 800 people in the Commission are currently working on enlargement , of whom around 300 work for the Enlargement Directorate-General .
Once the major round of enlargement is completed , it must be possible to redistribute these resources to work involving the enlarged EU .
As such , we need more background information before we can just agree to automatically increasing the number of posts by 500 .
The same applies to the RELEX reform .
The Reform of the Management of External Assistance promised as early as 2000 that further reform would be carried out in 2002 along with a review .
The Commission 's annual policy statement has promised a further review of the RELEX Directorate-General 's cooperation and efficiency .
We wish to see results on these points before we agree to 500 new posts .
We are also launching two new projects -an expanded border region project with SME cooperation across the union and a project on simplifying the administration of the whole EU .
This is an extraordinarily important project .
Ladies and gentlemen , today 's report , which the Committee on Budgets decided to draw up at the beginning of the year , is intended to reinforce its power of monitoring the implementation of the European Union 's budget .
The Committee on Budgets intends this report to discharge Parliament 's responsibility of establishing the Budget of the European Union , a responsibility conferred upon it by the Treaties , scrutinising the correspondence between the budget voted and its financial implementation .
This is an essential part of respect for the political priorities laid down each year by Parliament in its financial document , a part which the Commission is sometimes wont to overlook .
The Committee on Budgets had two aims : to state the situation of the first semester , identifying initial signs of deviation from the budget voted , and to provide the Commission with guidelines for the second semester .
The fact that there is no increase in the own resources ceiling during the current period of the financial perspective , 2000-2006 , makes it even more essential that these objectives , which will enable us to improve the efficiency of our expenditure , are achieved .
With a view to this , Parliament 's scrutiny has revealed two kinds of problem : the excessive and , at times , inappropriate use of the financial flexibility instruments and the poor implementation level for some headings .
To give you an idea of the amounts we are talking about , during the current financial year alone , the Commission has already presented transfers of a total volume of EUR 250 million and , for example , more than EUR 2 billion in payment appropriations were transferred during the 2001 budgetary procedure .
To improve this situation , the Commission is going to present an implementation schedule as of this year .
This new instrument , called for by Parliament and the Council together , will allow more accurate monitoring of the situation , although there will still be room for improvement .
Indeed , we feel that the Commission should present the plan at the same time as it presents the request to the Budget Authority and should , moreover , present the information as far as possible on a case-by-case basis .
To sum up , to establish a closer , more systematic link with the appropriations originally voted , assessment of requests should take into account the voted budget , the current implementation , the implementation profiles presented by the Commission , a timetable for the implementation of the remaining amount on the ' donor line ' and the investigations carried out by our parliamentary committees .
If this information is not deemed to be satisfactory , the transfer request will be rejected .
As a general rule , transfer requests which would reduce the budget lines voted by Parliament will not , therefore , be accepted .
On the other hand , the supplementary and amending budgets pose a different kind of problem and allow us to deal with unforeseen situations and make the necessary adjustments to the budget when the accounts from the previous financial year have been closed .
It was thanks to SAB 1 that a solution was found to finance the Convention . SAB 2 , and SAB 3 as well - which will be dealt with today - have , in actual fact , returned to the Member States a total amount of almost EUR 14 billion of payment appropriations which were not spent in the previous year .
In order to improve the track record and image of the European Union , we would like , with this report , to call upon the Commission to present a plan of how the payments cancelled in the 2001 budget can be rescheduled , to present before 30 September a proper assessment of payments in 2002 and to accelerate payments on old commitments or to decommit those and cancel the obsolete payment appropriations .
As things stand , for the end of the year , the Commission is forecasting an implementation rate of 100 % for commitments and 97 % for payments .
This was only 72 % in 2001 and , if these results are achieved , we will have made real progress .
As regards the next SABs , certainly the reconstruction in Afghanistan and , in all probability , the situation in the Middle East could require additional resources .
As regards reconstruction in Afghanistan , additional appropriations may only be used if the Commission is able to demonstrate that the appropriations already entered under the budget lines have been spent properly , taking into account the commitments given by the other donors too .
Ladies and gentlemen , as you can see , this is a somewhat technical report , but it does show how necessary it is for all our parliamentary committees to concentrate on monitoring the Executive .
I would like to say that , thanks to the excellent cooperation of all the shadow rapporteurs for the budget of the different committees , Mr Färm and I have in recent months created a number of monitoring groups for the various policies .
If the situation improves , it will be due not least to the work of the shadow rapporteurs for the budget , which is not always obvious .
Thus , in the future , the parliamentary committees will be able to make Parliament 's democratic control over the Commission even more effective .
I would point out that , on 15 June , outstanding commitments totalled over EUR 111 billion , which is more than the European Union 's annual budget .
Even if this figure is a reflection of the natural distribution of payments over time , a constant effort is still needed from the Commission to reduce the burden of the past .
Cancelling EUR 97 million of old appropriations would be an - albeit tentative - step in the right direction .
Lastly , I would like to point out that , although our cooperation with the Commission has certainly been fruitful in recent months , it may well be that we need to work together more closely to ensure that the final product is more in line with what the Budget Authority voted at the beginning of the year .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the amendment to the 2002 Budget also contains a number of administrative expenses , which I will disregard .
What is remarkable is the Court of Auditors ' proposal for self-protection against terrorism .
The Court of Auditors is following Parliament 's lead in this .
We too have stated that we are not prepared to go along with the absurd increase in premiums by the insurance companies which , following 11 September 2001 , actually refused to cover the risks of any future attacks .
I naturally hope that our refusal will motivate insurance companies to enter into negotiations with us .
After all , if self-protection becomes an issue for the medium or long term - there is also enlargement to include various institutions to consider - we will need to re-examine together how we can effectively cover and spread the risks that are related to this for the EU Budget .
Mr President , Mr Podestà spoke a moment ago about the enormous surplus in last year 's European Union Budget : EUR 15 billion remained unspent .
I am not exactly in favour of wasting money or spending it for the sake of it , but we must ensure that we actually honour the promises we have made to our citizens and those in other countries .
This surplus is not a one-off .
This will also be the case next year .
As you know , the largest surpluses were found in the Structural Funds .
This is logical , since these are major programmes that need time to get off the ground .
Funnily enough , some Member States will argue that it is beneficial to have such an illogical framework as we have now , because they can then expect higher refunds at the end of the year , which is very advantageous to the net contributors .
I think that the same line of reasoning is applied to the Commission 's civil service .
The European Union is accumulating an increasing number of tasks , a larger territory and ever more work .
However , if more officials were recruited , this would also mean that the work actually got done , that money was actually spent , and I think that this is not the intention of a number of Member States .
In my view , especially the net payers are all for making pledges , having too few people in service to carry out the pledges , blaming the Commission for this , and receiving a few billion of this back at the end of the year .
Mr President , I should like to finish off with a comment on the Färm report .
I should like to congratulate Mr Färm warmly on his work and wish him every success in all the work he is yet to do .
Needless to say , it is still a general resolution and the ultimate choices are still before us .
I can say that my group will be verifying the final Budget against at least three items .
Firstly , an assessment of the mid-term review of the agricultural policy .
Mr Färm now has the courage to refer to the word ' reforms ' , and rightly so .
Secondly , enlargement and thirdly , category 4 - external expenditure .
Both of these are concerned with whether we fulfil our promises .
If it was up to my group , we would .
We do not need any cheap seats in the front row , as long as the ultimate performance is worth watching .
Mr President , honourable Members , as Mr Färm has underlined , the purpose of this debate is to prepare the joint sitting of Parliament , Council and Commission prior to the Council 's first reading of the 2003 Budget .
Its primary concern will be with agriculture and fisheries , but funds for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and administrative expenditure will also have a large part in the proceedings .
In agriculture , the Commission preliminary draft of EUR 2 billion is below the upper limit .
I would like to reiterate that this is , of course , a very good thing in principle , as there must , in agriculture , always be leeway to take account of unforeseen eventualities .
I am grateful to Mr Färm for the report on the 2003 Budget in view of the conciliation procedure .
In it , you make the critical observation that , if another letter of amendment on agriculture is to be submitted in the autumn , then that might perhaps be brought forward .
All our experience of agriculture , in particular , leads us to say that autumn is a much better time than the first half of the year for making predictions as to how much will be required in a year , as overall expenditure is dependent to a very great degree on what happens in the summer months .
That can be taken into account in the autumn .
I would also like to refer to the marked change in the euro / US dollar exchange rate in relation to the Commission 's preliminary draft , in which we had assumed an exchange rate of 88 cents to the euro .
Now , of course , that has seen a great deal of movement over recent weeks , meaning that the margin in heading 1 for agriculture has already been reduced by between EUR 400 million and EUR 500 million .
Changes to date in the euro / US dollar exchange rate are thus causing an increase in expenditure of between EUR 400 million and EUR 500 million .
I should , perhaps , briefly mention veterinary expenditure , as there has been criticism of their reduction in the Commission proposal .
It is particularly in the veterinary field that the budgetary impact is contingent upon unforeseen eventualities , be they illnesses or epidemics .
That is why there has to be a margin available .
This line would then be replenished where appropriate .
The autumn will also see the submission of a document on the adaptation of the fisheries agreement .
Let me now again point out - with reference not to category 4 , but to fisheries as a whole - that the Commission will now also be putting forward a proposal on reform of the fisheries policy , one that will add EUR 32 million to the Budget heading ; these are intended for a programme of enquiries and related measures , so that the fisheries policy - especially as regards fleet reduction - will require a total of EUR 59 million from the flexibility reserve .
Let me briefly mention the Common Foreign and Security Policy . I am grateful to Parliament for welcoming the increase in funds specifically for the police mission in Bosnia , which is to begin in the course of this year .
I would , though , also like to come to an understanding in the course of the conciliation procedure as regards how decisions may be taken in future to achieve greater financial security .
The Commission had indeed put forward a proposal for a specific flexibility reserve , with which the Council found itself unable to agree .
I will observe that Parliament prefers what I would describe as the second best proposal and thus goes along with increased use of the emergency reserve for crisis management tasks of this kind .
Perhaps we can come to some agreement about this in the course of the conciliation procedure .
I shall deal very briefly with foreign policy , with regard to which I am already able to announce that the Commission is preparing to use this year 's Supplementary and Amending Budget No 4 to top up the margin of EUR 70 million , which is still there for foreign policy .
Last year , Parliament and the Council left this amount in the margin , stating that it should be used only when more precise information on a programme for Afghanistan became available .
All this will be put before you shortly .
Let me say something about the appropriations as a whole .
Mr Färm had also addressed the question of whether an understanding might already be reached on these .
I take the view that it is too early in the day to do this , and that this is due to issues of agricultural policy and , not least , the importance of the euro / US dollar exchange rate for the area of appropriations in general .
Appropriations also , of course , require that as definite a basis as possible be available for the purposes of forecasting .
This means that more information about the implementation of the 2002 Budget is needed , and this we will , of course , have as the budget year takes its course .
Your report , Mr Podestà , is concerned with better forecasting for the necessary appropriations and with the resultant improvement in harmonisation with the implementation plans for the current Budget year .
Whilst being very grateful for your report , I do think there needs to be more in-depth discussion in the Committee on Budgets on what we are actually aiming at .
At European level , we have a Budget made up of commitments , which means that there are always commitments outstanding .
The commitments still outstanding are not to be equated with late payment .
Let me put it this way . The greater part of European funds is spent on infrastructure and investments .
Investments cannot be made in the same year as the commitments are entered into .
To take the trans-European networks as an example , if commitments in this area always had to be implemented within a year , studies could be carried out , but the actual projects would not be able to be co-financed .
That is why commitments are always building up in this area .
What is of course important is that the dormant or abnormal commitments should be reduced , and I believe that progress has been made on this in the foreign policy area . Far greater use was made of last year 's foreign policy appropriations than had previously been the case .
Administrative expenditure is an important case in point , having featured in all previous debates on the 2003 Budget year .
The difficulty is that the financial programming allocated no funds to preparing the institutions for enlargement , even though it is agreed that the institutions have to take steps at least six months prior to the actual date of enlargement in order for their administrative systems to be ready for it .
In the preliminary draft of the Budget , the Commission had set aside an amount to cover these measures both in the Commission and in the other institutions .
Now , in view of the first reading , the Council has prepared a resolution that the Commission absolutely cannot support .
The position is that the Council wants to award itself an increase of 7 % for administrative expenditure , and , if certain measures - such as , for example , the cost of translating the acquis communautaire - are added , the Council is proposing a rate of increase for itself of 12 % over the Budget year 2003 and is financing it by cutting the Commission 's own rate of increase .
Such a proposal is extremely unfair , and the Commission will not accept it .
So I hope that an understanding can be reached about this in the conciliation procedure , with the result that this point will initially be left open , also allowing consideration of Parliament 's proposals , which are interesting .
At present , however , the Commission sees itself as having no option but to prepare to mobilise the flexibility instrument .
Just a few words on the Supplementary and Amending Budget No 3 .
I thank Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Podestà for agreeing to the proposal .
This means that the entire surplus is injected into the 2002 Budget , and , above all , posts are created which the Economic and Social Committee needs in order to take on the functions devolving on it from August onwards in consequence of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty .
The Council cannot hear me now , but I had the opportunity to say in Denmark yesterday what I am saying to you - that I hope that the Council , in the course of the conciliation procedure , will be open to Parliament 's arguments , as the mood and openness of the conciliation procedure leave their mark on the general atmosphere in which Budget discussions are conducted and on the course that they take .
Mr President , from the point of view of the Committee on Foreign Affairs one of our priorities has to be to ensure that our delegations in other Member States are properly looked after , in particular in relation to security .
In view of deconcentration we want to ensure there is a proper infrastructure in place for our delegations .
Secondly , we need to ensure that we have a proper civilian crisis management arrangement .
In relation to Kosovo , we are concerned about the cuts being proposed and we need more information as to why they are necessary .
If it is simply a case of how we upfronted our money , then that clearly is less of a problem .
On enlargement , as Mr Färm has already indicated , capacity is a key element that we must work on in the next 12 months .
I am encouraged by the commitment to greater cross-border activity , but I remain very doubtful about the way in which TACIS is currently being used .
Finally , we must be aware that there is always the possibility of the need for major intervention in the Middle East , and I would love to know where the money would come from .
Mr President , Commissioner , what is in front of us is very definitely an austerity Budget , or at least it is meant to be one .
In agriculture , we are EUR 2 billion below the level agreed in Berlin , which is itself EUR 10 billion below the previous guideline for agriculture , which has not yet been repealed .
We are on EUR 20 billion , lagging behind EUR 126 billion .
Every year , we repay billions of euro .
Parliament must , then , perform its function of making the greatest possible reasonable political use of the Budget that we have been promised .
That goes for agriculture as well , and I am grateful to Mr Färm for taking up the essentials of the suggestions that the agricultural sector has made to him .
It is precisely in the agriculture sector that there are disputes . Commissioner Fischler takes our suggestions on board while , on the essentials of conversion , going from the first pillar to the second .
He wants to convert some of the agricultural budget to be spent on enlargement , but what happens ?
It unleashes a discussion on savings in which you , Mrs Schreyer , are also participating , and , if I may say so plainly , I consider it a sham debate , as agricultural savings are not at all the point at issue .
Not much money finds its way into agriculture and into Europe 's rural areas ; indeed , to put it bluntly , it flows only in the wrong channels .
Great tasks lie ahead of us , and reforms cost money .
Once the reforms are underway , we will not be able to get back to talking about savings if we then have an austerity budget in front of us anyway .
That means that we have to achieve a balance between the first and second pillars if the reforms are to gain acceptance .
We will not support radical cutbacks within the first pillar .
I agree with you that it is easy to spend other people 's money , and it is clear that the net recipients have quite different ideas about this from the countries that are net contributors .
That must be taken into account , but the debate must not be allowed to end up as a perverse discussion on austerity ; on the contrary , it must be about the reforms , and not simply a matter of saying that cuts make for the best agricultural policy .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would first of all like to highlight the slow pace at which the programming for regional policy for 2000-2006 has been implemented in terms of the use of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund and ISPA .
In this sense , the new penalties are not an exception and , nevertheless , despite our delay in approving their guidelines , a large number of programmes have been put before the European Commission , which shows that Parliament was right to defend these actions , which promote a direct relationship between Brussels and the regions .
I also think that we should provide more advice for the candidate countries on how to put together their proposals and increase the percentage of Community funding .
With regard to the line of funding of the European transport networks in this financial year , the level of completion is still very low , which leads us to believe that there may be more interest in some trans-European projects in the Member States surrounding them than in the actual Member State where they are taking place , which will have to be responsible for the majority of the funding .
In general terms , I do not think that it is the municipalities and regions that are responsible for the poor budgetary implementation , given that , first of all , it is we in the European Institutions who have taken a long time to approve and define the guidelines and programmes . We have also allowed very short deadlines for using the financial resources : two years from when they are budgeted .
This deadline is very hard for the regional institutions to comply with when they receive Community approval for their projects very late and have to respect standards of democratic transparency for invitations to tender in order to put together the projects , have them approved , find partners , conduct subsequent public invitations to tender for the contract to carry out the work , etc. All this means that it takes more than two years for the work to begin , as the Commissioner said .
We should not try to erase Community policy aimed at the regions of the Union , but rather we should increase it in order to correct the regional imbalances and , above all , we should listen to these infra-State bodies more , not pass on our own slowness in planning and making decisions to them , and put ourselves in their position , with the problems they have in successfully completing their projects , and help them .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , in the debate held in the Committee on Fisheries , emphasis was placed on the importance of maintaining appropriate funding for the sector , and it is therefore important to have quick and substantial information on the implications of the reform of the common fisheries policy for the budget for 2003 , because account must be taken of this Parliament 's resolution of 17 January of this year , which rejected the Commission 's plan substantially to reduce structural aid to the fisheries sector and which stated that it shared the hopes of the sector , which are to defend the continuation of Community aid for the modernisation of the fleet through structural measures which , as you know , the Commission is not considering in the proposal that it submitted on reforming the common fisheries policy .
It is equally important to have more precise information on the appropriations earmarked for international fisheries agreements , given the importance of those that were signed last year and the development of new international relations .
Nevertheless , we support the proposal to mobilise the flexibility instrument to provide EUR 27 million to finance the remaining appropriations allocated to the restructuring programme for the fleet previously operating in Morocco .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is natural that we should at first ask ourselves whether it makes sense for one half of the budgetary authority to be using a parliamentary debate and a parliamentary resolution to set down its strategy for a conciliation procedure before the Council 's first reading .
I would fundamentally question Parliament 's wisdom in doing this in view of the relative emptiness of the Council bench .
What we are discussing here is not going to find its way over to the other half of the budgetary authority .
I am nonetheless very grateful to Mr Färm for giving us this opportunity to consider our overall approach to the 2003 Budget year long before discussions on individual Budget lines take place .
Let me just make a couple of observations .
Firstly , Commissioner , my view of a supplementary Budget by which we return EUR 15 billion - that is far in excess of 15 % of our Budget - to the Member States , is that it is somewhat comic . On the other hand , in order to draw up the 2003 Budget , we find ourselves having to mobilise the flexibility instrument to secure administrative expenditure - that is , in one of the areas where it does not belong .
Something is wrong here .
This has relatively little to do with the requirement that the Budget be true , clear and transparent , or with all the theoretical things we spend our time discussing in this House .
I would also like to point out that the flexibility instrument was not introduced in Berlin in order to enable the Commission to redeploy funds in anticipation of the Budget being drawn up , but in order to facilitate up-to-date responses to current political challenges .
Administrative expenditure is not a current political challenge ; on the contrary , it is something that , as a matter of principle , has to be borne by the Budget .
Let me also address the issue of civil crisis management .
We in the PPE-DE group have great reservations about the creation of any new piggy bank or flexibility instrument intended to be called on for finance in such problem areas .
I have little sympathy for the way the Commission is pushing this idea , even though it is well known that the Council will not take it up under any circumstances .
This is where we could have done with something more intelligent .
We in the PPE-DE group have proposed something that I hope the majority in this House will support , namely that we should allocate Budget funds to this by means of the emergency reserve and also find a road down which the Council can go all the way .
Commissioner , I will conclude by saying one more thing . I am slowly getting sick of the way we have the same procedure every year for promoting town-twinning .
Now you have again decreased the amount of funds allocated to that heading .
The Council makes further cuts - we are used to that - and we end up having to top the funds up again .
You know perfectly well what Parliament wants , so just put it into the Budget proposal .
We should not have to carry on fighting each other like this .
Mr President , let us not lose sight of the fact that the Färm report is about giving Parliament some guidelines for the conciliation that will take place on 19 July .
If this year 's conciliation is anything like last year 's then I for one have no desire to attend .
I can find something far better to do on a Friday than sit there facing the Council .
We make our case on the three areas of discussion and the Council then ignores everything .
Those three areas are agriculture , fisheries and CFSP .
As regards agriculture we can make the points made by our colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture , especially the priorities which they see for agriculture , and we can talk about category 2 and the CFSP .
I would like to pick up a point made by Commissioner Schreyer - and this is what I heard through the English interpretation , not the Finnish interpretation - when she said that EUR 59 million would be needed and the flexibility instrument would have to be used .
One point is that we do not yet have a common fisheries policy .
If and when we do have one , that will be a problem for next year .
However , we still have the problem of the EUR 27 million and I await with interest to see what the Council will do with that sum on 19 July .
Once we know the Council 's intentions , then we can make some decision as to what to do ourselves .
The third aspect is the CFSP .
As Mr Titley said , we will be supportive of a lot of the things that have been mentioned , but the increase of EUR 10 million in the CFSP means that something else in category 4 has to give .
That is a dilemma for us .
There are areas where I would hope we can get decisions on 19 July , which makes it worthwhile for me at least to go .
That will be on category 5 and probably as regards the category 4 flexibility instrument if there is going to be such a thing .
It is obvious that the Council will never agree to a new flexibility instrument , but if we can get some agreement on using the existing emergency reserves in a similar way for category 4 , which would be by a codecision procedure , we may make some headway .
But category 5 is the big area .
It is obvious that Council will want us to agree at their first reading to their proposals for category 5 .
I do not think that is possible but if we could get an agreement as to what we want to do throughout the year , then we can come to some conclusions .
We should also give serious consideration to frontloading for next year in category 5 .
Mr Podestà 's report has highlighted underspends in this year 's budget .
In category 5 last year , EUR 70 million was underspent .
On average in category 5 , there is EUR 50 million underspent each year .
If we can take the underspends from this year and use a global ramassage for all the institutions , then we may find some method of frontloading to save the pains of next year 's budget .
Hopefully if we can do that , then we will make some progress with the Council and it will be worth going .
Mr President , firstly I wish to thank the rapporteurs , Mr Färm , Mr Podestà and Mrs Buitenweg , for their excellent reports .
The package before us reveals the present state of EU budget administration : frankly , it is wretched .
A full 16 % of the entire budget for last year 's payment appropriations - EUR 15 billion - remained unspent .
The implementation of the budget was the poorest on record .
The figure for outstanding commitments has risen to EUR 110 billion , which is more than the EU 's annual budget .
We are justified in asking whether there is any other organisation in the world which has such a disastrous record regarding the implementation of its budget .
The situation is particularly poor regarding the Structural Funds .
A total of EUR 10 billion of payment appropriations remained unspent , and , accordingly , there is an increase in the figure for outstanding commitments . While , at the start of last year , they stood at EUR 38 billion , in one year and four months they increased to EUR 82 billion .
This shows that the EU 's structural policy is in danger of collapse unless its implementation gets a new lease of life .
The present system does not work .
The legislation should be completely revised .
Next year 's budget is now beginning to take shape .
It has problems with payment appropriations , which are at their lowest level for years - just 1.03 % of Community GNI .
This is actually EUR 4.72 billion below the ceiling set for the financial perspectives , although the increase in outstanding commitments has been explosive .
There was no provision in the draft budget to reduce the RAL .
Another problem is administrative expenditure , which exceeds the financial perspectives by EUR 66 million .
The Commission is proposing the use of the flexibility instrument with regard to this .
My group absolutely opposes this .
Administrative expenditure must be able to be kept below the financial ceiling by means of internal transfers and savings .
The flexibility instrument is meant to cover unforeseen expenditure .
Mr President , Commissioner , next year 's budget is lighter than normal .
The share it represents of the combined GNP of the Member States is lower than it has been for years .
In addition , we all know that a part of the appropriations still remains unspent .
The criticism Mr Virrankoski before me made is a portrayal of just how ineffective the Commission has been , and is a criticism I fully endorse .
For some reason the Commission is allowed to execute programmes that are important for the Commission and not execute programmes that are important for Parliament .
The interinstitutional agreement on the budget was concluded just before this Parliament 's term began .
Certain restrictions that go back to that time are making it difficult to draft next year 's budget .
The areas that are causing problems are category 4 , which deals with external action , and category 5 , which deals with the administrative expenditure of the institutions .
As we know how finances are managed in the EU and we know that a large proportion of appropriations will remain unspent , many of our budgetary problems are mainly technicalities , and not real .
We are becoming concerned about matters that do not suffer from lack of funds for their implementation .
Category 4 contains ' RAL air ' and there is much scope for flexibility in category 5 without it being necessary to increase it by introducing the so-called flexibility instrument .
Our real problems are connected with enlargement .
With current levels of expenditure the EU is still not ready for enlargement in 2004 .
We lack the proper language skills and workspace .
The EU saves money all the time it does not enlarge .
Appropriations were set aside for enlargement under Agenda 2000 . These have not been used , as enlargement is to start later than planned .
The use of this money for enlargement when it takes place should be safeguarded , but , technically , from the EU 's point of view , it is money that has been lost .
The share of appropriations that are the Council 's responsibility in the area of the common foreign and security policy is increasing , and we should furthermore introduce a proper auditing and discharge procedure with regard to the Council 's budget .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Färm , for his work .
We are all aware of the difficulties involved in the management of the budgetary procedure and the pressure on those who are responsible for it each year .
If I might venture an opinion , however , the situation this year appears to be much more complex and problematic .
In theory , it is two years until enlargement actually takes place but , in reality , the machine has already been set in motion and funds will have to be set aside from the 2003 budget to finance the changes necessary , especially at administrative level .
We all know that we are not ready , that our budget is inadequate to deal with the current situation , that it is inadequate for the financial perspective for the current period and will leave us at the mercy of any unforeseen developments .
That is why I feel that we Members must be bold and demand a political response to the current impasse during the conciliation procedure , not accounting tricks or half promises , which are unworthy of our responsibility .
It is tedious to go over the same ground again and again but , at the risk of seeming extremely boring , I would stress once again my position , which is based on one major assumption : we Members of Parliament and our institution have exactly the same dignity , as a branch of the Budgetary Authority , as the Council , and this means that we are by no means bound to bow to the decisions of the Council without making our mark .
There is no law saying that our role is merely to limit the damage done by a short-sighted political structure which is only more powerful in its own opinion : we are politically and morally accountable to millions of the European electorate for our financial management of the Union , and we are certainly not going to say to our citizens ' We knew all along and we said so at the time but the Council would not listen ' .
This is why I would stress that , even now and especially considering the heading 5 problems facing us and more long-standing problems such as the RAL , we must force the Council to find a political solution and follow it through as necessary .
It is better to be bold now than to be sorry later .
The tenor of the Färm report is more and still more money for the EU 's policies .
Even if the EU were the right body to take over an ever-increasing number of tasks from the national governments ( which it is not !
) , the implementation of the Budget belies this increase in funds .
As a result of a stagnating implementation of Community policy , the monies claimed back by the Member States in 2001 amounted to no less than EUR 15 billion on balance .
Surely , this discovery should set off alarm bells .
As paragraph 26 of the Podestà report states , payments lag behind outstanding commitments by such a margin that the total payments yet to be made exceed the European Union 's total annual budget .
Should we not conclude in all honesty that the Commission apparatchiks are unable to manage effectively all these commitments , with which the budgetary authority has saddled the Commission over the past few years ?
Surely the budget is simply too generous ?
Mrs Buitenweg 's conspiracy theory fails to convince me .
I would therefore call for the appropriations to be brought in line with the Commission 's implementing capacity and only for effective programmes .
The EU should confine its remit to those areas of policy where European action clearly has added value .
Finally , I should like to highlight paragraph 14 in the Podestà report : by 1 September , we want precise information concerning the use that both partners in the peace process make of funds received from the European Union , what control mechanisms are in operation and what penalties should apply in the event of misuse of those funds .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a pity that representatives of the candidate countries or even more of the public are not here today , for they would realise the peculiar nature - for lack of a better expression - of this joint debate .
Indeed , as many speakers have observed thus far , on the one hand , Parliament and the Commission are asking us to mobilise the flexibility instrument to cover what is ultimately run-of-the-mill , if excessive , expenditure , which means drawing on our last reserves - in terms of covering the expenditure for heading 5 , when I consider that we are in a building which we really do not need , I think to myself that that may well be an area in which savings could be made - and , on the other , that we are preparing to make a gift to the Ministers for Finance of our countries , who are in great need of it , of at least EUR 14 billion of unspent funds which , very often , they themselves have failed to use .
' You can not fool us ! ' , as a great Italian comic used to say .
In other words , we cannot continue along this path , saying in European Summits that we do not have the money to finance enlargement , reaching the lowest implementation level of recent years , as Mr Virrankoski said , with a ridiculous figure compared with the ceilings fixed in Edinburgh and elsewhere , and then finding ourselves in this situation .
I feel that it is on this that our effective credibility will depend in forthcoming years .
If the States feel they need the thousands of billions of euro that we return to them each year , that is a worrying , but it is just as worrying that a situation such as this should arise .
This is what I wanted to emphasise in this debate in which both the Commission and Parliament have a back seat .
The message is chiefly for the Council .
Mr President , it is always helpful to have a debate before our first reading of the budget with the Council later this month , but the resolutions in front of us from Mr Podestà and Mr Färm highlight a substantive contradiction , at least for me and for my group .
Firstly , on the one hand we have under-utilisation of funds , where clearly , with the balance recovered by Member States now amounting to EUR 15 billion for the 2001 financial year , as Mr Färm points out , there is a significant financial and political problem , especially as regards insufficient payments in the Structural Funds .
However , as Mr Virrankoski said , there has of course been poor implementation of payment appropriations amounting to EUR 82 billion .
Is this because of the matters Mrs Buitenweg raised about Member States not wanting to use these funds ?
Is it poor procedures ?
Is it simply rigidity ?
It could also be related to co-financing , where the monies are not available in the Member States , in which case we need to take some care about the next steps for agricultural policy , because we could find ourselves in some difficulty if we rely on Member States to implement programmes .
Secondly , there is a contradiction between external policy and administrative policy .
We are actually looking for funds to implement programmes decided by the Council or by our institution in the budgetary procedure .
We know that Parliament has not actually approved the Afghanistan funding of EUR 1 billion and yet we see the Commission and the Council gaily going ahead , assuming that this will be the case .
Therefore , in the light of these two very contradictory approaches , it seems to me and to my group very logical that we should ask the Commission for more flexibility in the way in which finance can be transferred from one part of the budget to the other , because on one side we have too little and on the other we have too much .
Yet , we find the Socialist Group wants to delete paragraph 12 .
Their speaker should justify why they oppose such a logical approach .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Podestà Report on implementation profiles is a very important one , and I would like , at the very outset , to express my thanks to Mr Podestà , the rapporteur .
Anyone who knows me will know that this is not one of my usual ritual practices , but I do think Mr Podestà deserves thanks for taking over the task from our erstwhile colleague and general rapporteur for 2002 , Carlos Costa Neves , and for taking over the job I started to do in 2001 , observing the implementation of the Budget over the course of the year .
That is a laborious business and far less appealing that the work on the forthcoming Budget year .
How the Commission implements the Budget and makes use of its resources for the purposes that we decide on at the end of the preceding financial year deserves proper scrutiny .
Looking at the course of a Budget year , one sometimes wonders how closely the intentions of the budgetary authority have been adhered to .
A Budget year can positively teem with supplementary and amending budgets and much carrying-over of appropriations .
Closer examination reveals that , taken as a whole , the appropriations carried over add up to a redeployment of funds from one line to another totalling some 1 % of the total Budget .
Not that much , then , one might think .
But , as several Members of this House have pointed out , a lot of funds are not spent at all !
From the 2001 Budget , the Member States are getting EUR 15 billion back , that is , over fifteen times the total of appropriations carried over .
Even though we cannot generally accuse the Commission of disregarding our policy intentions , all of us together - by which , in this instance , I mean not only the members of the Committee on Budgets , but also the members of the specialist committees - have to support the Commission right through the year and see to it that they do not lose sight of our policy intentions .
Trust is a good thing , but control is a better one .
Mr President , as draftsperson of the opinion - on the Budget - of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , I should like to say that we have chosen not to issue an opinion on the 2003 Budget because our viewpoints are very well covered by the general observations in Mr Färm 's excellent report .
I should nonetheless like , however , to highlight two points : first of all , the failure - already mentioned many times today - to implement the budget for the structural funds .
The same problem exists in connection with the Social Fund and , because there is no long-term development of infrastructure in this area , I think this is a matter that should be viewed very seriously .
My second point concerns the agencies , of which we are acquiring an ever-greater number .
We must ensure that there is no overlapping of tasks when we set up agencies , but we must also ensure that the agencies are able to carry out their tasks and that their budgets for 2003 put them in a position successfully to complete the preparations for enlargement in 2004 .
Finally , I should like to mention that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs attaches importance to priority 's being given in the Budget to the new strategy relating to the working environment .
Mr President , when , a few months ago , we established the guidelines for the 2003 Budget , there was widespread agreement in the European Parliament on three priorities for category 5 . These were the preparations for the coming enlargement , necessary institutional reforms and managing both enlargement and the institutional reforms within the budgetary framework .
If , at its meeting in Copenhagen in December , the European Council decides to carry out a big bang , in which 10 new countries become Member States in time for the next elections to the European Parliament in 2004 , this will place extraordinary demands on the system .
There is no greater challenge than this .
Through its far-sighted policy , the European Parliament has worked long and hard to bring about the coming enlargement .
This work will now continue in the 2003 budget .
If all this is to be managed successfully , enlargement must be given the greatest priority in all EU institutions and must also have a tangible impact on the ongoing budgetary work .
With this in mind , it is positive and encouraging that the incoming Danish Presidency has made very clear that enlargement is its main priority .
This work must also make inroads in the EU 's own organisation .
During this year , it has been expressed extremely clearly , not least by the European Parliament , that each institution must complete preparations for enlargement before 2004 .
This places particular demands on next year 's budget .
The conciliation with the Council in just over two weeks will form an extremely important part of this work , not least regarding the opportunities to reach an agreement concerning category 5 .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would briefly like to say that if we want to provide citizens with good and efficient management of the Union 's resources , it would seem sensible to take advantage of the experience we have gained over the years with the financial framework in force .
What lessons can we draw from this , ladies and gentlemen ?
That we cannot continue with methods that result in such a massive failure to implement funds .
We could also talk about mistakes in provisions or shortcomings in implementation .
The truth is that we are talking about the consequences of a structural fault , as our colleague Mr Podestà so rightly said .
Year after year our Group places an emphasis on reforming the working methods in order to achieve greater efficiency , transparency and flexibility in budgetary policies , because that is , to a large extent , what is required for citizens to have confidence in the European plan .
Therefore , when we see public debates on financial balances , we know that something is being done wrong .
Parliament has also shown that it wants and demands a European administration fit for the twenty-first century but , at the same time , we demand efficiency , monitoring and transparency .
The budget for next year faces old and new problems that we have to solve , and solving those old and new problems requires , above all , that we use common sense in our decisions .
Restricting spending is common sense , as is demanding that the Council curb the increase in administrative costs .
It is also common sense that , if we advocate Community agricultural and fisheries policies , financial decisions should comply with the true meaning of those words and that the institutions should honour their commitments .
Therefore , the budget for 2003 should fund the second stage of restructuring the Community fleet affected by the expired fisheries agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco .
Ladies and gentlemen , I sincerely believe that there is room for negotiation and consensus , and I hope that , for the benefit of all , a good result will be achieved in the next round of negotiations .
In order to do this , all we need to do is to be guided by common sense .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 12.30 p.m .
The next item is the joint debate on the European Council report and Commission statement on the European Council meeting held in Seville on 21 and 22 June 2002 , and the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council ( Spanish Presidency ) .
I should like to record , on behalf of all of us , my gratitude to the Spanish Presidency and the President-in-Office of the Council for the courtesy which they have extended to Parliament and to me in the course of their presidency .
In particular , I wish to underline their willingness to work with us to try to establish for the future a dialogue between the institutions on how better to do business with each other and , more particularly , how we do business on behalf of our citizens .
Mr President , President of the Commission , honourable Members , when I presented the priorities of the Spanish Presidency of the European Union to you , I undertook to come to the European Parliament to present the results of the Seville European Council and to make a final assessment of this six-month period .
I would like to begin my third appearance before you by expressing my satisfaction with the work done by the institutions throughout the Presidency , and the good relations between Parliament , the Council and the Commission during the past six months .
This good atmosphere of understanding is largely due to the efforts of President Pat Cox .
The European Parliament and its President have made a substantial contribution to the work of the Presidency .
This House has adopted the legislative approach proposed by the Lamfalussy report , the Fourth Framework Programme on Research and the Financial Regulation .
Also , during the last six months the Council and Parliament have adopted a definitive text on access for the European Parliament to Council documents on foreign , security and defence policy , and we have reformed the European rules on the common electoral procedure .
Regarding the first matter , the Seville European Council welcomed the significant boost given to interinstitutional dialogue during the Spanish Presidency .
A good example of this is the creation of the High Level Technical Group for Interinstitutional Cooperation , which represents a qualitative leap in those relations .
That group should be the foundation for the future interinstitutional agreement on simplifying and improving the regulatory framework , to be adopted in December 2002 .
Ladies and gentlemen , when I presented the Presidency 's priorities to you , I said that Spain would work to :
strengthen the Union 's response to terrorism , from the point of view of building an Area of Freedom , Security and Justice ;
increase modernisation of the economy ;
help complete the enlargement negotiations ; and
lay the foundations for the future European Union .
I think that I can say that progress has been made in each and every one of these areas .
The Presidency has moved forward with the measures in the European Union 's plan of action against terrorism .
This objective would not have been possible without the support of Parliament and particularly without the support of the Commission .
I remember very well that my last appearance in this House coincided with a terrorist attack in Italy .
I am confident that such acts will be increasingly difficult to carry out as a result of the measures that we have adopted over recent months .
We have managed to step up the European Union 's fight against terrorism by formally adopting , among others , the Framework Decisions on the Fight against Terrorism , the Framework Decision on the Arrest Warrant and the Common Position on the Freezing of Assets .
All of these measures strengthen cooperation between the security bodies and forces of the Member States , help to increase the Union 's international cooperation in the fight against terrorism and extend the scope of that fight to the whole of its support structure .
As part of the development of the Area of Freedom , Security and Justice , Spain had proposed , as one of the aims for its Presidency , the creation of a common immigration and asylum policy .
Europe needs immigration and the majority of Europeans understand this , but in recent times we have seen the emergence of criminal mafias trafficking human beings .
In order to combat illegal immigration , the Seville European Council decided to adopt a comprehensive and balanced package of measures seeking to :
fight illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings ;
establish a coordinated and integrated management of the Union 's external borders ;
speed up work on defining a common asylum and immigration policy ; and
integrate immigration policy into the Union 's relations with third countries .
Allow me to expand on the last two points , which attracted the most public attention .
The European Council decided to speed up the legislative work in progress on defining a common asylum and immigration policy by carrying out a series of specific actions within a specific timetable :
by December of this year , we will adopt the conditions for determining which countries are responsible for processing asylum applications in the European Union ;
by June 2003 , we will adopt rules on refugee status , reuniting families and the status of long-term permanent residents ; and
by December 2003 , we will adopt common standards for asylum procedure .
We think that immigration needs to be incorporated into the Union 's policies towards third countries , taking into account various factors : increasing economic cooperation , expanding trade , development aid , and preventing conflicts , as these are the methods chosen by the European Union to reduce the causes of migration .
The Council has therefore declared that it is willing to increase cooperation with the countries of origin of immigrants and countries of transit .
If we want the Union 's aid for combating illegal immigration to be effective and also credible , we must be capable of evaluating and revising it according to the results obtained , in order to be able to react in the event of a clear lack of cooperation in curbing illegal immigration .
In this case , and in exceptional circumstances , the Union reserves the right to adopt measures , as part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Union 's other policies , while respecting the agreements it has made .
The entry into circulation of the euro was an impetus for the Barcelona European Council to decisively resume the process of economic and social modernisation .
As you will recall , the results of the Barcelona European Council were examined by this House when I attended on 20 March .
I would just like to expand on the economic elements of the Seville European Council .
The recent European Council approved the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines , reaffirming the commitment to achieving a budgetary balance by 2004 and the need to continue with economic reforms , as the only way for the Union to increase its growth and achieve full employment , an objective that we agreed in Lisbon for this decade .
Following the milestone of the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the Community and Member States , and the good results of the Monterrey Summit , we now have two solid foundations from which to approach the World Summit on Development in Johannesburg .
This Summit will be an opportunity to fulfil our objectives of fighting poverty and environmental degradation and to promote the development of the less advanced countries .
These goals will be a reality if in Johannesburg we adopt a balanced vision of all the facets of sustainable development .
This is why the Seville European Council highlighted , among other things , the efforts made by the Union to promote initiatives in the areas of water , energy and health and to play a leading role , from a constructive angle , in Johannesburg .
Another of the Presidency 's priorities was to move forward in enlargement negotiations .
The timetable for the negotiations given to the Spanish Presidency was very demanding .
By the end of this six-month period , the chapters on regional and cohesion policy , the policy of the institutions , financial issues and agriculture had to be closed . I think that the results can be described as positive .
The Spanish Presidency has negotiated a total of 96 chapters , 52 of which have been provisionally closed , and 22 of which have been opened for the first time .
This means that the negotiations have entered their final stage and I hope that the next European Council in Brussels will be able to nominate which countries will be able to complete the negotiations this year .
Allow me to dwell for a moment on the issue of direct payments in the agricultural chapter .
This was the most complex subject in the negotiations , given the particular sensitivity of some Member States .
The Seville European Council came up with a compromise formula that enables us to begin to negotiate with the candidates on the vast majority of the agricultural issues .
The remainder of the elements in the financial package of the enlargement negotiations will be communicated to the candidate countries by November at the latest .
The European Council in the autumn will therefore be able to decide with which candidate countries the negotiations can be completed at the end of 2002 .
In this section I would also like to mention the progress made by Bulgaria and Romania , and encourage Turkey to continue with the necessary reforms and comply with the economic and political requirements , which apply to all the candidates .
Honourable Members , as President-in-Office of the European Union I inaugurated the work of the European Convention on the future of Europe on 28 February .
In Seville , Chairman Giscard d ' Estaing presented a report on the progress of the Convention and the various forums in which civil society has expressed itself .
The European Council supports the general approach of the Convention .
Another matter that the Seville European Council dealt with was the ratification of the Treaty of Nice by Ireland .
The ratification of the Treaty of Nice is a necessary condition in order to move forward , and I consider the Declaration on the ratification of the Treaty of Nice by Ireland to be important , confirming that this Member State 's policy of neutrality will not be affected by that ratification .
As you are also aware , the Laeken European Council asked the Secretary-General of the Council , Javier Solana , to present a report on the reform of the Council .
Based on this , and in accordance with the Barcelona European Council , in Seville the Presidency presented three groups of proposals on the reform of the Council .
The first group was aimed at substantially changing the preparation , development and decisions of the future European Council .
The preparation work of the European Council will be the task of the new General Affairs and External Relations Council .
Other measures were also adopted that will simplify the work of the European Council and make it more flexible .
Meeting times will be limited and clear and concise conclusions will be adopted .
In Seville a fundamental step forward was made in admitting that , in extraordinary cases , the Council may use the direction of the discussions of the European Council in order to continue to make progress on particular matters , in accordance with the procedures established in the Treaties .
The second group of proposals was aimed at making the structure and functioning of the Council of Ministers more efficient and transparent .
In order to achieve this , the Council has created this new General Affairs and External Relations Council .
This new Council will prepare and monitor the work of the European Council , will be responsible for horizontal coordination and will guide all of the European Union 's external action .
The Seville European Council also decided to decrease the number of Council of Ministers formations from sixteen to nine , adopted the rules for cooperation between Presidencies and adopted rules enabling Council sessions to be open to the public when it is acting in codecision with the European Parliament .
Finally , the Spanish Presidency has launched the debate on the six-month presidencies of the Union .
Changing the current six-monthly system of presidencies means reforming the Treaties .
This decision needs to be taken by the next Intergovernmental Conference .
In any event , the Copenhagen European Council must continue and expand on this discussion , based on the principle of equality between Member States .
During the Spanish Presidency , the Union has also pursued intense external activity .
The European Union summits with the United States and Canada helped to strengthen the transatlantic link .
The Summit with the United States reaffirmed the special political commitment that the Union has to the United States , by adopting the agreement on the negotiation of an agreement on judicial cooperation in criminal matters , extradition and mutual assistance .
Europe must support Russia in President Putin 's clear commitment to defending democracy and starting on the road to reforms .
It was important that the European Union Summit with Russia was successful .
The inclusion of the fight against terrorism as a new sphere of cooperation between the European Union and Russia , the recognition of Russia 's status as a market economy and defining the bases for an agreement on Kaliningrad are all reasons to be optimistic about the future development of relations between the European Union and Russia .
In mid May , the second summit between the European Union and the Latin American and Caribbean countries was held .
One of the objectives of this Summit was to promote regional integration in the area .
It was therefore agreed that political and cooperation agreements would be negotiated with Central America and the Andean Community , and the formal document concluding the Association Agreement between the European Union and Chile was signed .
Spain also proposed , as a priority objective for its Presidency , driving forward the Barcelona Forum , the only process in which Israelis and Palestinians directly meet .
For this reason , the fact that the Euro-Mediterranean Conference , where the European Parliament was represented , was actually held , can be described as a success .
In Valencia the Association Agreement between the European Union and Algeria was signed , and recently the Association Agreement between the European Union and Lebanon was also signed .
The Summit also adopted the Euro-Mediterranean Framework Programme on Justice and Home Affairs , adopted the reinforced Facility within the European Investment Bank and the Action Programme for the Dialogue between cultures and civilisations , and created the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation to promote that dialogue .
The Spanish Presidency was particularly attentive during times of serious crisis in the Middle East .
This is the reason for the two declarations adopted during the European Councils .
The Spanish Presidency has worked constantly to step up its cooperation with other international players .
The importance of the Quartet , which met for the first time in Madrid , and of the Declaration adopted by the European Union , the United States , the Russian Federation and the United Nations are proof of that effort , which is continuing today , as Special Envoys of the Quartet are meeting to continue coordinating their actions .
Strengthening the European Security and Defence Policy was also one of the priorities of the Spanish Presidency .
The Seville European Council adopted the Declaration on the contribution of the Common European Security Policy to the fight against terrorism . That is a first step for integrating the fight against terrorism into the Security and Defence Policy .
During the Spanish Presidency , the European Union has also confirmed that it is prepared to take on the task of policing in Bosnia-Herzegovina , on 1 January 2003 , and has expressed its desire to take over operation ' Amber Fox ? , in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
Finally , I would like to point out that the Spanish Presidency has conducted all the negotiations in order to reach an agreement on the participation of European allies that are not Member States of the European Union in European defence .
Spain and the European Union need to continue to work actively on this matter .
Honourable Members , today I came to the European Parliament to explain the results of the Spanish Presidency of the European Union , and in particular of the Seville European Council .
I think that we have moved forward on each of the Presidency 's priorities , despite the problems and uncertainties that we have faced during past months .
The euro has entered into circulation without problems and was extremely well received , the European Council has decisively resumed the process of economic and social modernisation of Europe , the Union has played an important political role in the world and , finally , we have faced the problems arising from illegal immigration and succeeded in responding firmly to the threat of terrorism .
All of these steps should increase our confidence in the European plan , which is a formula that has been verified and is based on success .
That success is based on two principles that we should not forget : respect for different points of view and constantly seeking a balance and the Rule of Law .
It is only from this twofold perspective that we will be able to face the two most immediate tasks that our future holds : enlargement and the reunification of Europe and the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , which will define our institutional system .
I do not want to finish without offering my best wishes to the Danish Presidency and assuring it , of course , of Spain 's support throughout the next six months , just as they have actively cooperated with us .
Finally , I would like to end as I began , by thanking you and President Cox for the work that you have done during the Spanish Presidency .
I would also like to thank the Commission and its President , Romano Prodi , for their cooperation . Without that cooperation , many of the results that I have come to present to you today , would simply not have been possible .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , 2002 is a crucial year for European integration - a year marked by projects and challenges of huge political and historical significance such as enlargement and the debate on the political and institutional nature of the Union today and in the future .
In the last few months , another challenge has caught our attention - immigration - which calls for more reflection on the balance we need to achieve within our societies in Europe and in relations between the northern and southern hemispheres .
We are quite familiar with the difficulties involved in these challenges and we must pay tribute to the Spanish Presidency , which has guided the Union through the last six months as it tackled all these problems with drive and wisdom .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank President Aznar , his ministers and all those who worked with him for their work .
I would add , moreover , that cooperation between the Presidency and the Commission has reached great heights . The Commission and Spain have established a method that can , I hope , be applied by all future Presidencies .
One of the Union 's successes in these past six months has been the way the roadmap for enlargement has been followed .
At Seville , we made further progress : we achieved common positions on the chapters on agriculture and the Structural Funds and we identified the last hurdles to overcome .
In the autumn , by the Brussels European Council in October , to be precise , we must have agreement within the Union on certain budgetary issues and , in particular , on direct payments to farmers .
Sometime in the autumn too , the citizens of Ireland will be taking part in a second referendum to ratify the Treaty of Nice .
I have every confidence that , this time , the debate will focus on the real substance of the Treaty rather than on other issues wrongly laid at the Union 's door and I therefore have no doubt that the outcome will be positive .
In this connection , I see the European Council 's declaration at Seville on respect for Ireland 's military neutrality as highly significant .
I therefore continue to look forward to the Copenhagen European Council with great optimism . We are gradually overcoming the potential obstacles to a definitive decision on enlargement .
The great commitment displayed by the candidate countries over the last few years deserves to meet with success .
I cannot stress too often that enlargement and the related reforms are and will remain our main political priority and that the Commission will spare no effort to reach that goal , a goal whose strategic importance stretches far beyond the confines of Europe .
Asylum and immigration were high on the Seville European Council 's agenda , and what prevailed at Seville were common sense , good judgment and moderation .
Illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings are unacceptable and the EU has made it clear that it will do its utmost to put a stop to them .
This is not just a declaration of intent .
At Seville , clear recommendations and timeframes were laid down , for example for the conclusion of the re-admission agreements currently being negotiated and the launching of talks with the other countries identified by the Council , the implementation of joint operations at external borders before the end of 2002 , and the introduction of common visa arrangements by March 2003 .
The importance of these timeframes must in no way be underestimated .
Experience teaches us that we can only make coherent progress by setting definite dates .
I assure you we will work to ensure those commitments are met on time .
Overall , however , immigration calls for a comprehensive approach that takes all the political , social and human dimensions fully into account .
Border control is bound up with asylum policies , security is linked to ensuring fair treatment for all the citizens and internal security , and the effectiveness of the various decisions and measures within the Union depends on the relations with third countries and the development cooperation we are able to achieve too .
